Input: the table containig our inputs.

Output: If we don't select anything, the output page will be containig the image fig4.png " mise a jours",
        If we change our input the output.json will be shown. 

BONUS: we used FETCH to get the image 
       we also used addEventListener to detect if any value has been changed from the inputs that's why we implement the onChange event instead of onClick.
